cargo
=====

C ARGument Obtainer. Alternative command line parser to getopt.

Designed to be small and easy to drop into any program without much configuration.

Compiling
---------

Simply drop into your project and compile, no configuration needed.

To compile the tests simply define `CARGO_TEST`. For example using `gcc`:

```bash
$Â gcc -DCARGO_TEST=1 cargo.c
```

Or on Windows using the visual studio command line:

```bash
> cl.exe /DCARGO_TEST cargo.c
```

More advanced compiling
-----------------------

To enable running the tests easily on any platform there's also a CMake
project that can be used to generate `Make` files or a `Visual Studio`
project for instance.

Both for Windows and Linux
###########################

```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..        # Add -DCARGO_DEBUG=<level> for debugging output.
$ cmake --build . # You can use 'make' also, but not with Visual Studio.
$ ctest           # Run the tests.
```
